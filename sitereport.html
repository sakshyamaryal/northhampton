 <h1>MY experience in Learning Web Development</h1>
<p> As i am always curious student i was fond of computers and how its mechanism works since my childhood. AS a field of interest i choose to learn computing for my future. I have thought to make my passion my profession.</p>
 <p>It has been really good experience for me learning web development because i have experience of coding c-programming for 1 years. This web development module  has made my base of coding strong and made my ability to type code faster. I learnt that nothing is easy to achieve as i have been trying hard fulfilling the requirements of the assignment.</p>

<h1>Ups and downs</h1>
<p>It was difficult to understand the basic of web development and i made many mistakes. Still i didnot have good sense of designing. For me HTML was not so hard but Css made designing tough for me but now i think that it is more easy to design every website using CSS rather than using HTML only. I am still struggling to do Hamburger icon and i am still trying my best to make my webpage beautiful.</p>
<p>This has to be one of the best module for me as this module is making everyone's coding and designing bases strong.</p>

<p>I developed this site by giving my best i searched best design possible for my website. Talking about technical i did not use any things that we are not able to do. This is done by my own i didnot use any software that autogenerate the codes.</p>
